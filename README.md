Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a platform companies use to manage and integrate the essential parts of their businesses. Many ERP software applications are critical to companies because they help them implement resource planning by integrating all the processes needed to run their companies with a single system.

An ERP software system can also integrate planning, purchasing inventory, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and more.

## What Does ERP Do?

ERP applications also allow the different departments to communicate and share information more easily with the rest of the company. It collects information about the activity and state of different divisions, making this information available to other parts, where it can be used productively.

ERP applications can help a corporation become more self-aware by linking information about production, finance, distribution, and human resources together. Because it connects different technologies used by each part of a business, an ERP application can eliminate costly duplicates and incompatible technology. The process often integrates accounts payable, stock control systems, order-monitoring systems, and customer databases into one system.

## Why is ERP important?

Sometimes described as “the central nervous system of an enterprise,” an ERP system provides the automation, integration, and intelligence that is essential to efficiently run all day-to-day business operations. Most or all of an organisation’s data should reside in the ERP system to provide a single source of truth across the business.

Finance requires an ERP to quickly close the books. Sales needs ERP to manage all customer orders. Logistics relies on well-running ERP software to deliver the right products and services to customers on time. Accounts payable needs ERP to pay suppliers correctly and on time. Management needs instant visibility into the company’s performance to make timely decisions. And banks and shareholders require accurate financial records, so they count on reliable data and analysis made possible by the ERP system.

The importance of ERP software to businesses is illustrated by the growing adoption rate. According to G2, “The global ERP software market is projected to reach US$78.40 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 10.2% from 2019 to 2026.”
